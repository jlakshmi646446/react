      <p>In 2019, Sephora announced a new tagline and manifesto, “We Belong to Something Beautiful,” to reinforce our dedication to fostering belonging among all clients and employees and to publicly strive for a more inclusive vision for retail in the Americas.
        In 2020 Sephora launched our Diversity and Inclusion Heart Journey to support our vision of becoming the Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity Champion in the retail industry.
        A leader in prestige omni-retail, our mission at Sephora is to create a welcoming beauty shopping experience for all and inspire fearlessness in our community.
        We operate over 2,700 stores in 35 countries worldwide, with an expanding base of over 500 stores across the Americas, and a world-class ecommerce site. Since opening our first US store in New York’s SoHo neighborhood in 1998, Sephora has been an industry-leading champion of diversity, inclusivity, and empowerment in the US, guided by our longstanding company values.

  <p /><h3>Some products that seem to be cosmetics may be classified differently and managed by different programs at Health Canada:</h3>
  Products that claim to have a therapeutic effect (e.g. to prevent or treat disease), or that contain certain active ingredients not allowed in cosmetics are considered to be drugs, for example, topical antibiotic creams.
  Products containing natural active ingredients that claim to have a therapeutic effect (for example, a topical herbal remedy to speed scar healing) are considered natural health products.
  Items that are intended to be eaten and do not have a therapeutic effect or claim are food products, such as chewing gum.
  Insect repellent lotions and sprays are pesticides.
  Products that provide a therapeutic benefit to animals, like dander-reducing creams, are veterinary drugs.<p />
